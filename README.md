# clockJS
Just another simple javascript clock. 

## How to use this app
Just go [HERE](http://cpusillo.github.io/clockJS) and check the time!

## Future contributions
* Change timezone via the UI
* Add additional clock functionality like timers and city views.

This was really just meant to be a quick exercise. Nothing much to see here.
